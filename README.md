Hello ,

The "End to End Hotel Booking Analysis Using Python" project aims to investigate and analyze the hotel booking data to identify the reasons behind the decline in sales. This data analysis project will be carried out in a Jupyter Notebook using Python, leveraging powerful data manipulation and visualization libraries.

# Project Description :-

The objective can be broken down into the following detailed component.

âœ… Understanding the business problem.

âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data cleaning

âœ… Analyzing the data to get useful insights

âœ… Presenting the findings and solutions to the problem using a Report

- Here is the comprehensive report of the analysis conducted on this project: *https://github.com/NikhilPanda01/End-to-End-Hotel-Booking-Analysis-Using-Python/blob/main/Hotel%20Booking%20Analysis%20Report%20.md*

# Data Source:
The Hotel Booking data available on Kaggle.
Download data CSV files: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking

# Approach :
Approach:

1. Data Loading: Download the hotel booking dataset from Kaggle and load it into Jupyter Notebook using Python.
   
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and format date columns for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the dataset, visualize booking trends, overall_cancellation_percentage, Avarage Daily Rate in Hotels, Reservation status per Month, Top 10 Countries with Canceled Reservations & ADR Per Month on Basis of Cancellation etc.

4. Time Series Analysis: Utilize time series techniques to identify patterns and seasonality in bookings over time.

5. Sales Decline Identification: Analyze historical sales data to pinpoint the reasons for the decline in bookings.

6. External Factors Analysis: Investigate external factors such as holidays, events, and travel restrictions that may have impacted sales.

7. Report Generation: Prepare a comprehensive report that documents the entire analysis process, presents the key insights, and offers data-driven solutions to address the sales decline issue.

8. Insights and Recommendations: Summarize the findings in a comprehensive report, and provide actionable recommendations to address sales decline and improve business performance.

# Suggestions:
Below are the suggested recommendations for our clients to enhance their business 

- Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.

- As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.

- In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
    
- They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
